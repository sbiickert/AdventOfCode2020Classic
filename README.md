# AdventOfCode2020Classic
 Learning C++98 on a 20-year-old PowerBook

## Background

I recently upgraded my old PowerBook G4 with an SSD. I blame [this video](https://youtu.be/_2jvRgRQXIE) and the fact that the SSD and the mSATA to IDE enclosure only cost me $50. It’s an old computer and slow, but by the standards 20 years ago it’s a rocket ship, especially now that it’s got a super fast and huge drive. I turned the screws and installed the SSD.

So, what do you do with an old laptop? Code, of course. I started with learning the PowerPlant framework by Metrowerks, and it became clear that my C++ knowledge was a real shortcoming. I started digging into the STL and figured that the Advent of Code was a good match for learning the basics. Especially since I have already solved it in a language (see my Swift repo) that I know.

## How's It Going?

Pretty well. I have finished three days so far. Each day I've been adding another C++ technique. Day 01 was using vectors and iterators. Day 02 introduced using structs and parsing strings. Day 03 saw my first class and using std::auto_ptr, as well as working with integer numbers larger than 4 bytes.

The challenge is that using late-1990’s coding tools means that even a language as venerable as C++ has changed a lot since then. I have learned that the Metrowerks Standard Library that comes with CodeWarrior is a C++98 compliant version of the STL. That means I can do some Google searching for pre-C++11 examples on how to do things. There still are some gotchas, but it’s better than nothing.
